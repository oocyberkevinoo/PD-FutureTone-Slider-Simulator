# PD-FutureTone-Slider-Simulator
A recreation of the HORI PS4/Switch Slider, for Project Diva: Future Tone.
The code itself is based on the [touchgadget/toucharcade](https://github.com/touchgadget/toucharcade) Repo, just going to the essential part to adapt it to your own Arcad eSLider Gamepad solution.
