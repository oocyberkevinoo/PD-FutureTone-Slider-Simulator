# PD-FutureTone-Slider-Simulator
A recreation of the HORI PS4/Switch Slider, for Project Diva: Future Tone.
The code itself is based on the [touchgadget/toucharcade](https://github.com/touchgadget/toucharcade) Repo, just going to the essential part to adapt it to your own Arcade SLider Gamepad solution.

All the Slider basis source is in [Slider.css](https://github.com/oocyberkevinoo/PD-FutureTone-Slider-Simulator/blob/main/Assets/Slider.cs) and contain nothing Unity related, so you can take the code and adapt it to whatever you need it to run on.



(Also, the simulator is based on AZERTY keyboard layout, cause QWERTY developers nevers helped me too :3 )
