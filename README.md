# PD-FutureTone-Slider-Simulator
A recreation of the HORI PS4/Switch Slider, for Project Diva: Future Tone.
The code itself is based on the [touchgadget/toucharcade](https://github.com/touchgadget/toucharcade) Repo, just going to the essential part to adapt it to your own Arcade SLider Gamepad solution.


(Also, the simulator is based on AZERTY keyboard layout, cause QWERTY developers nevers helped me too :3 )
